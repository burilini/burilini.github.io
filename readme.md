WELCOME...
to my Technical Development Portfolio.  This portfolio has been assembled as part of the MIT xPro Full MERN Stack Coding track.  Here you will be able to learn more about myself, get a feel for my style and take a look at some of the many projects I have been working on.  Just select the section you would like to see from the menu.  The portfolio items will demonstrate my mastery of three development languages, JavaScrip, HTML and CCS.  You can also pay attention to some of my graphic and layout abilities.

WHERE I'M HEADED
Please keep visiting!  I plan to add some of my graphic work, as well as, some of my maps and layouts of data for business software development.  I still plan to keep access to my GitHub Repositories, but you will access through the project modal. I plan to change things up as I learn more complex and interesting projects.  I would like to keep my cards to 6 for ease of management.

I am hesitant to give out too much info about myself, so I will be adding a contact form in the contacts area.
